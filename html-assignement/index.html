        <p>Hello, my name is Anas Jahfa. I am an art enthusiast. This is the 2<sup>nd</sup> time that i take the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD program </abbr>. 
        I am interested in reading, and I enjoy researching and studying topics that are new to me. I studied economics during my secondary education in high school, after that I took a year formation in photography, then I took a 2-year multimedia design program.</p>
